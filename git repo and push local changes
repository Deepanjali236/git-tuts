:: STEP 1: Go to your project folder (replace with your actual path)
cd "C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\Git-tuts"

:: STEP 2: Initialize the current folder as a Git repository
git init

:: STEP 3: Add only the specific HTML files you want to track
git add code_1.html frontend.html

:: STEP 4: Commit the changes with a clear message
git commit -m "Initial commit with only code_1.html and frontend.html"

:: STEP 5: Connect your local repo to your GitHub repository (replace with your real URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Deepanjali236/Git-tuts.git

:: STEP 6: Rename the branch to 'main' (optional if it's already 'main')
git branch -M main

:: STEP 7: Push your committed changes to GitHub, forcefully replacing anything there
git push -u origin main --force
